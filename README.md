# Fetch
- Fetch - makes asynchronous requests
  - Javascript is single threaded - only does one thing at a time
  - Fetch allows us to multitask
  - Fetch sends a request and waits for a response
  - Fetch returns a promise
    - Promise has 3 states:
      - pending
      - fulfilled
        - gets payload as a result
      - rejected
        - gets error
